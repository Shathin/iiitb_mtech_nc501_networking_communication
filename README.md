# NC501 Networking & Communication

### Introduction

This repository contains notes and resources for the NC501 Networking & Communication course, which was part of my coursework during the 1st Term of my M.Tech program at IIIT Bangalore between 2020-2022. The course was taught by Prof. Debabrata Das and Prof. Jyotsna Bapat.

### Motivation

Originally, these notes were compiled on my [Notion page](https://shathin.notion.site/NC-501-Networking-Communication-59476c51650c4a478a58a55fb84a2bc3), but I am now migrating them to GitHub. This move aims to open up the content for collaboration from new students and to share this resource with a broader audience. By making this knowledge more accessible, I hope to contribute to the learning journey of others who are exploring this subject.

### Disclaimer

Please note that the content might not be complete as it was created during my time in the M.Tech program, and I havenâ€™t actively maintained it since. Therefore, it is open for collaboration from other students of IIIT, Bengaluru who are interested in contributing to and expanding the content.
